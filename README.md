Platformer Adventure Game
ðŸŽ® Reach the Top in a World of Platforms!
Welcome to my platformer adventure game, a side-scrolling journey where the goal is to navigate a series of challenging platforms to reach the top. This project is a dynamic exploration of game mechanics, character animations, and balanced game progression â€“ and itâ€™s still evolving!

ðŸš€ Project Status
This game is currently in development! Iâ€™m actively working on features, game balance, and adding new, exciting elements to enhance the player experience. Keep an eye on this repository as I add updates, including new animations, smoother transitions, and gameplay mechanics.

ðŸŽ¯ Game Objective
Players guide a robot character through ascending platforms, dodging obstacles and aiming to reach the top. The game is designed to be challenging yet rewarding, with engaging gameplay mechanics and fluid transitions to keep the action fresh.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Ascending Platform Design: Players must carefully time their jumps to avoid missing platforms as they climb.
Fixed Starry Background: A static starry sky provides depth and ambiance, highlighting each level without unnecessary distractions.

Balanced Difficulty: Each platform and obstacle is designed to offer a challenge that grows with player skill.
ðŸ“… Planned Updates
Enhanced Visual Effects: Smooth transitions between stages and additional 3D effects to add depth.
New Obstacles & Challenges: Introducing varied hazards to test players' skills and increase replayability.
Score & Achievement System: Reward players for reaching new heights with a point system that adds motivation and a competitive edge.
